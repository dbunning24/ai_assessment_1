• Set the scene for your research in the introduction and provide an overview of
the events that have occurred.

• The literature review should explain the problem you are trying to solve and
provide a background to the AI systems and the domain problem.

• The methodology should identify the metrics, the dataset, and how the
systems were created. Ensure that you clearly explain the critical design
decisions of the AI systems and the underlying fundamental logic.

• The Results and Discussion section should outline the results and then your
understanding of what the results mean. Ensure you apply critical analysis to
the results and explain/challenge what they show.

• The conclusion is where you summarise your research paper, giving key
insights into the findings of the problem.

• The Reference section is essential and should be linked to the references used
in your paper. Ensure that the Harvard or ACM style is used.
